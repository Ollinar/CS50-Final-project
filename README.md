# **QUIZER**
#### Video Demo: - [ ]Url here
#### Description: This Is the final project for CS50 that I've decided to make. It's a a simple web application about making, sharing, and taking quizes. 

#### **Implemented Pages:**
* A page to register
* A page to login
* A logout button in nav bar
* Index page when a user first visits the site
* Index page when a user is logged in
* A page with list of quizes
* A page to make a quiz
* A page to take a quiz
* A page to show the score the user got

#### **To be Implemented Pages:**
* A page that shows the ranking of people that took a quiz - I still can't decide how this should be implemented. It could either be public that everyone can see it, or private that only the quiz creator can see it.
* A page to change password - new idea
* A page to manage quizes made by user - new idea
* An about page - new idea
